QtSu - what is it?<br>
<br>
A simple GUI written in Qt5/6 that allows you to run a program as root.<br>
<br>
Although there are other programs of theis type most if not all rely on polkit or have a large number of dependencies, apps like ktsuss which this app was inspired by ( avaiable here:http://ktsuss.googlecode.com/files/ktsuss-2.tar.gz ), some like ktsuss seem to have been abandoned ( last commit was 2011 ).<br>
<br>
Also it seems that whenever polkit ( which is a nightmare! ) is updated these programs break, so this is the result there are few dependencies a reasonable recent gtk and glib and thats it.<br>

<br>
Installation<br>
<br>
Just run ./autogen.sh from this folder then make and sudo make install.<br>
QtSu will use the default Qt version installed ( 5.x or 6.x, version 6.x will be prefered ).<br>
Default is to build for Qt but for now the gtk version can be built by passing --enable-gtk to autogen.sh.<br>
WARNING! the gtk version is deprecated and WILL be removed soon.<br>
To install to ( say ) /usr instead of the default /usr/local, add --prefix=/usr, --enable-ktsuss-link will as it says link ktsuss to QtSu so that some programs that hard code the files think that ktsuss is being used ( spacefm ).<br>
<br>
If your distro disables the root account ( I'm looking at you Ubuntu! ) you may have to set a root password like so:<br>
Open a Terminal and type:<br>
sudo su<br>
passwd<br>
<br>
Enter a new password for root twice you may also have to run these two commands whilst logged in as root:<br>
<br>
pwconv<br>
grpconv<br>
<br>
Finally logout<br>
exit<br>
<br>
You can now type roots password in to the QtSu gui and run commands as root.<br>
<br>
Usage:<br>
<br>
QtSu [OPTION] [--] <command><br>
Run a command as another user<br>
-u, --user USER			Runs the command as the given user<br>
-m, --message MESG		Change default message in ktsuss window<br>
<br>
Simple usage:<br>
qtsu terminal.<br>
<br>
If you need to add options use -- like so:<br>
qtsu -u root -- kkterminal --hold -e ls -AF /<br>
